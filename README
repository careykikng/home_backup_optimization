This project houses an Excel file that calls a Python optimization code that schedules backup generator (supply) to power demand in a home off-grid application.

In the Excel file, the user inputs a set of desired backup generators (and their characteristics) for a home assumed to be off-grid (such as during a grid power outage), an assumed 15-minute weather profile for the home, and a set of appliances to run using the backup generators.  There are many backup generator options (e.g., electric vehicle connected to the home, portable gasoline generator, photovoltaic panels, etc.) and home appliances (microwave, refrigerator, air conditioner, mobile phone charger, etc.).
